    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>My name is Jasmine Rio De Oro. I am a student at BYU-Hawaii from the Philippines, and I love traveling.</p>
    <p>This site shares some of my favorite trips, including Fiji, a Mexico cruise, several U.S. states, and the Hawaiian Islands, along with my dream of visiting Europe one day.</p>

      <h3>Where I've Been</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fiji:</strong> I fell in love with the culture and the food. It reminded me of the Philippines, and it was my first time in a while eating real, fresh chicken—it was so delicious!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mexico (cruise):</strong> The tacos were incredibly good. I tried fresh seafood tacos from a famous spot called La Guerrerense, and they were unforgettable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hawaii:</strong> Living and studying here feels like being in paradise. The mountains and beaches are breathtaking like a picture-perfect scene. I also love the diversity of cultures at BYUH, which has helped me learn about and respect many different backgrounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Utah, Washington, California, and Nevada:</strong> Each state gave me a different kind of experience. I hiked Mt. Rainier with friends in Washington, visited many LDS temples in Utah, crossed the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, and saw my first snow at Mt. Rose in Nevada during springtime.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why I Built This Site</h3>
      <p>
        I built this site to document my travels and hopefully inspire other students. It can be hard to balance school and work, but I believe it is important to make time to explore new places and learn from other cultures. If we wait until we are too old or too busy, we might miss those opportunities. I want to start young, collect meaningful memories and photos, and be able to look back and say, “I really did that, and I made the most of my time.”
