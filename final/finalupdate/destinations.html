    <h2>Destinations</h2>

    <p>
      These are some of the places I have been able to visit so far, along with my dream destination.
      I wanted to put them in a table so I can see my journey in one place and show other students that
      it is possible to travel, even while balancing school, work, and other responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the places I have visited so far are around the Pacific—different islands and states that still feel
      connected by the ocean. Europe is my “stretch” dream, something bigger that I am working toward as I continue
      my studies and career. Looking at this table reminds me of how far I have already come and how much I have
      learned from each place. It also motivates me to keep exploring the world in a smart, budget-conscious way
      while I am still young.
