    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Jasmine Rio De Oro, and I was born and raised in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental,
      in the Philippines an archipelago of about 7,641 islands. Growing up, I loved exploring different
      places whenever I had the chance. I have visited Cebu, Manila, and Baguio, and I also served my
      mission in Olongapo, which helped me see more of my own country and meet people from many different
      backgrounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before coming to Hawaiʻi, I had a layover in Guam, which felt like a small preview of island life
      outside the Philippines. When I finally moved to Hawaiʻi, I promised myself that I would see more
      than just Oʻahu. My first trips were to Maui, Kauaʻi, and the Big Island, and after that I began
      traveling to different states on the U.S. mainland. Each new place has given me memories,
      perspectives, and stories that I carry with me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Travel also connects deeply with my major. As an accounting student, I am interested in how
      businesses and people live, work, and manage money in different parts of the world. Visiting new
      places lets me observe real-life examples of culture, economics, and everyday life that I could
      never learn only from a textbook. Traveling gives me a healthy break from school, helps me reset,
      and reminds me that there is always more to life than grades and deadlines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many things I know about other cultures I learned by actually being there—talking to people, trying
      their food, and walking through their streets. These experiences motivate me to keep exploring
      while I am young, to collect memories and lessons that will shape the kind of professional and
      person I want to become.

      <h3>What Travel Means to Me</h3>
      <p>
        Travel, to me, means giving myself the chance to experience things I would never see if I stayed
        only in my hometown. Each trip reminds me that there is so much more to life and that every
        journey is unique. I am grateful for the indelible memories I make in every place I visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through traveling, I have seen how beautiful Filipino culture is and how rich the cultures of
        other countries are as well. I have met people from many different faiths and backgrounds and
        learned from the way they live and what they value. I also love trying new dishes and cuisines
        that I never imagined I would enjoy. All of these experiences shape how I see the world and who
        I hope to become in the future.
