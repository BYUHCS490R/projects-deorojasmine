    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Jasmine Rio De Oro, and I was born and raised in the Philippines, an archipelago of about 7,641 islands.
      Growing up, I loved exploring different places whenever I had the chance. I have visited Cebu, Manila, and Baguio,
      and I also served my mission in Olongapo, which helped me see more of my own country and meet people from many
      different backgrounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before coming to Hawaii, I had a layover in Guam, which felt like a small preview of island life outside the
      Philippines. When I finally moved to Hawaiʻi, I promised myself that I would see more than just Oʻahu. My first
      trips were to Maui, Kauaʻi, and the Big Island, and after that I began traveling to different states on the U.S.
      mainland. Each new place has given me memories, perspectives, and stories that I carry with me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Travel also connects deeply with my major. As an accounting student, I am interested in how businesses and people
      live, work, and manage money in different parts of the world. Visiting new places lets me observe real-life
      examples of culture, economics, and everyday life that I could never learn only from a textbook. Traveling gives me
      a healthy break from school, helps me reset, and reminds me that there is always more to life than grades and
      deadlines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many things I know about other cultures, I learned by actually being there talking to people, trying their food,
      and walking through their streets. These experiences motivate me to keep exploring while I am young, to collect
      memories and lessons that will shape the kind of professional and person I want to become.
