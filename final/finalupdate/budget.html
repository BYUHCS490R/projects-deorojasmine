    <h2>Travel Budget &amp; Planning</h2>

    <p>
      As a full-time student, I can't just book a ticket whenever I feel like it. Every trip I take has to be planned around
      school, work, and my responsibilities. Because of that, budgeting has become a big part of how I travel. I try to map out
      my expected costs, decide what I can live without, and focus on the experiences that matter most to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I plan a trip, I usually start with the big categories: flights, transportation, housing, food, and activities.
      From there, I estimate how much I can realistically spend in each area. I look for student discounts, stay with friends or
      family when possible, and try to be flexible with dates so I can find better prices. I also learn from other students'
      experiences and articles about budget travel.

      Travel also connects with my accounting major. When I build a simple budget for a trip, I am basically doing a small
      financial plan: setting goals, tracking expected expenses, and comparing them to what I actually spend. It is a reminder
      that money is a tool, not just a number. Learning to use it wisely now, even for things like travel, helps me develop good
      habits for my future career and family life.

      <h3>My Tips for Budget-Friendly Travel</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start planning early so you can watch for cheaper flights and flexible dates.</li>
        <li>Set a total spending limit and divide it into categories like food, transportation, and activities.</li>
        <li>Look for simple or free activities—hikes, beaches, walking tours, or temple visits.</li>
        <li>Travel with friends and share costs for housing, rides, and food when possible.</li>
        <li>Use travel as a reward and motivation, but avoid going into debt just to take a trip.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      Budgeting does not remove the fun from travel; it actually makes it possible. When I know I have saved and planned ahead,
      I can enjoy each trip without stressing about money the entire time. My goal is to keep exploring while being smart and
      intentional with what I have, so I can continue traveling long after I graduate.
