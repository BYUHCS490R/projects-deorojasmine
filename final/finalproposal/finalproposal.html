    <h2>1. Title and Topic of My Site</h2>
    <p>
      Jasmine's Travel Adventures: Islands, States, and Europe Dreams
    </p>

    <h3>Why I Chose This Topic</h3>
    <p>
      I chose this topic because traveling has been a big part of my life and personal growth. Moving from the Philippines to Hawaii and exploring different states and countries has helped me appreciate culture, diversity, and new experiences. I already have many photos and memories that I can use for original content, so this topic is easy to build authentically. Travel also fits the honor code and allows me to express my creativity while sharing useful information for other students who want to explore the world. It's meaningful, personal, fun, and tied to who I am right now at BYUH.

Table includes columns for destination, type (country/state/island), visited/dream, highlights, and notes.</li>
      <li><strong>Page 3:</strong> A page explaining how I plan trips as a student, including budgeting, saving money, sample expenses, and general travel safety tips. </li>

    <h2>4. Collecting Content and References</h2>

    <h3>How I Will Collect Content</h3>
    <p>
      I will create all content for my website using my own words and personal travel experiences. I will only use photos that I took myself from my trips to Hawaii, Fiji, Mexico, and in the U.S. I will paraphrase any factual information I read online and cite it properly in my references section. I will not copy and paste text from any website. All the HTML and CSS code will be written by me. This method ensures that everything on my site is original and compliant with the honor code.
    </p>

    <h3>Planned References</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Official Hawai'i Tourism Website</li>
      <li>Official Tourism Fiji Website</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Warning Acknowledgement</h2>
    <p>
      I have read and understand all the warnings for this project. I will not copy any text from other websites, and I will only use photos that I personally took or that are properly licensed. I will not copy another student's HTML or CSS code. I will not use ChatGPT or any AI system to generate the HTML, CSS, or written page content for my final project website. Everything I submit will be my own original work.
