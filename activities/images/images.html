            Answer the following questions on your page:
            1. What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG? JPEG is best for photos with lots of colors and details, like family pictures or landscapes. It compresses the file size well but may lose a little quality.
            2. What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF? GIF works best for simple images with limited colors, like logos, icons, or basic graphics. It's also used for animations since it supports moving images.
            3. What is unique about the PNG format? PNG supports high-quality images without losing detail and can handle transparent backgrounds. This makes it great for web graphics and overlays.
            4. How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed? You can use a photo editing tool to set the exact width and height of the image before saving it. Then, insert it into your HTML with the proper size.
            5. Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? Resizing with software makes the file size smaller, so the page loads faster. If you only resize with CSS, the browser still loads the big file, which slows down your site.
