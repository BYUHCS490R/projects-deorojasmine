        Answer the following questions:

        <p>List out the different ways to select an item. You can select items in HTML/CSS using tag names (like p), classes (like .highlight), IDs (like #title), or attributes (like input[type="text"]). You can also combine selectors, for example div p selects all "p"tags inside a div.</p>
        <p>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?An ID is unique and should only be used for one element on the page. A Class can be shared by many elements and is often used to apply the same style to multiple items. </p>
        <p>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag? A SPAN is an inline element, meaning it stays within a line of text and is used for small sections. A DIV is a block element, taking up the whole width, and is used to group larger sections of content. </p>
        <p>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER? A DIV is just a general container without meaning, mainly for layout. Tags like HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER are semantic, meaning they describe the role of the content, which helps search engines and screen readers. </p>
        <p>What are the different ways to select a color? You can select colors using names (like red), hex codes (#ff0000), RGB values (rgb(255, 0, 0)), or HSL values (hsl(0, 100%, 50%)). You can also add transparency using RGBA or HSLA formats. </p>
