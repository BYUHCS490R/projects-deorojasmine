            1. Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS. Answer: Inline, embedded, and external CSS: Inline CSS is written directly inside an HTML tag, embedded CSS is written inside the style tag in the HTML file, and external CSS is kept in a separate .css file and linked with link
            2. Explain why you should only use external CSS. Answer: External CSS is best because it keeps your styling separate from your HTML, making your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and reusable across multiple pages. 
            3. What is a selector used for? Answer: A selector is used in CSS to target specific HTML elements so you can apply styles to them (like changing the color of all <p> tags).
