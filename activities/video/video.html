    <p>1. What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube? Positives: YouTube hosting is free, fast, and easy to embed into your HTML page with just one iframe.
    Negatives: You don't control the ads, recommended videos, or distractions that YouTube shows around your content.</p>
    <p>2. What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform? The most useful thing a CSS transform does is let you move, rotate, scale, or skew an element without changing the actual layout of your HTML page. </p>
    <p>3. What is the schedule for the rest of the class? The schedule is basically the final project work period, where you build your multi-page website, finish your form processing, and submit the final project at the end of the semester. </p>
