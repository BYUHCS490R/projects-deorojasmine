        <p>In Pres. Nelson's talk he talked about peace: <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng">Talk</a></p>
        <p>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path? The is the landing page of the website, the page getting loading when they don't have anything in the path. A path shows the location of a file or page. The path is like giving directions: “go inside this folder, then open this file.” </p>
        <p>What is a default document? A default document is the file your website loads automatically when someone visits your site without typing a file name.</p>
        <p>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links? Absolute link: full web address, including https://. Relative link: points to a file in your own site using the path. </p>
        <h2>Relative</h2>
        <a href="otherpage.html">Other Page.</a>
        <p>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</p>
        <p>List the 3 rules with relative links.
        Use the correct folder and file names (spelling and capitalization matter).
        Use ../ to move up one folder if needed.
        Keep paths short and organized so links don't break. </p> 
        <p>Link to your last project.</p>
        <h2>Last Project</h2>
        <a href="../projects/profilepage.html">This is the link for my last project</a>
        <p>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag? No. It can be anywhere in the page. </p>
