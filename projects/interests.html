        <p>I love cooking and it has been the thing that helps me not to miss the Philippines. I started just watching my mother in the kitchen making food for us and then suddenly out of curiosity, I wanted to learn. Whenever my Mom is cooking I would normally be actively helping her out. </p>
        <p>I know there are a lot of things that I need to improve and become better in what I'm doing. Right now how I practiced it is I cooked in my apartment and then sometimes be invited for dinner. I would volunteer to cook some Filipino Food which my friends get to be so excited about. </p>
        <p>A relative link in HTML is a type of hyperlink that points to another file or page based on the current location of your HTML file, instead of using the full website address. <a href="../projects/profilepage.html">Profile Page</a>
        </p>
        <p>An absolute link, on the other hand, is a hyperlink that uses the full web address (URL) to point to a resource, no matter where your HTML file is located. For example, here is an absolute link  to a website about Filipino recipes: <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/filipino-recipes-23650147">Filipino Dishes</a></p>
