          <h3>Eep's Sunrise Route</h3>
          <p>
            Eep mapped a safe morning trail that reaches the high ridge before the heat.
            She tested the path twice and marked shade stops with stacked shells.
            The family voted to use the route on gathering days because it shortens the
            climb and avoids the sleepy croc-birds near the river.

          <h3>Grug Builds a Sun-Wall</h3>
          <p>
            After a hot week, Grug tied woven leaves between two tall roots to make a
            shade screen for the resting spot. It held through afternoon wind and kept
            the food pile cool. Guy is sketching a lighter version so the screen can be
            rolled and carried on trips.

        <h3>Discovering New Land</h3>
        <p>
            After days of wandering through narrow canyons, the Croods reached the edge of a vast valley filled with
            sunlight, tall trees, and strange colorful plants. For a long moment, they stood together in silence,
            watching birds glide across the open sky. Grug held back tears of pride while Eep and Guy planned how
            to explore safely. The family agreed to call the place “Tomorrow,” a name that reminded them how courage
            and hope can lead to new beginnings.
