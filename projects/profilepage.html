    <h1>Hi, my name is Jasmine Rio De Oro</h1>
    <p>I am currently a senior <strong>Accounting &amp; Business Major</strong> student. I have been in the island of Oahu for more than <italic>three years.</italic> I am grateful that I decided to pursue my education here becuase of the great opportunities we have in school. The Brigham Young University-Hawaii is a wonderful place to <em>"Enter Forth to Learn and Go Forth to Serve"</em> which is primarily the school's motto. Some of the things I have been grateful for the past years are the following:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>The opportunity to serve in the House of the Lord as a <mark>temple worker.</mark></li>
        <li>The blessing of being a full-time student as I pursue my education while working as a part-time <mark>Tour Guide in the Polynesian Cultural Center.</mark></li>
        <li>The people I meet not just from where I came from the Philippines but <mark>all the world</mark> who become part of my <mark>Ohana.</mark></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I am excited for the next chapter of my life especially graduation is in the next two semesters. Sometimes I become a bit anxious about what to do next. Whenever I felt the pressure I strive to remember that aligning the things I wanted to what Heavenly Father's wants me to do. I go to the temple and seek spiritual guidance, constantly prioritizing Him. I love one of the famous qoute I live by from, <h2>&nbsp;President Ezra Taft Benson</h2><blockquote>"When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives." </blockquote> </p>
