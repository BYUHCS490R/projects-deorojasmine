       <p>When I think about a Superhero the first person that came in my mind would be Superman. We all love him and I remember when I was young he inspires me to do good ot human being. His stroy is very touching and how he grew up without his family and foudn a new family at the same time the love of his life. His journey was not easy but very inspiring because he loves to help the people in earth. </p>
